# Introduction

The city of Chicago keeps an extensive public record of all reported incidents of crime from 2001 to the present,$^2$  updated every seven days.At the time of analysis for this project this data set contained a total of approximately 7.42 million rows (each row is an incident of a reported crime) and 22 columns. The main interest of this project was to analyze this crime data set along with the incidence of baseball sporting events in the corresponding community areas of Chicago in an effort to see whether a relationship existed among the variables. We specifically looked at the major league baseball team the Chicago White Sox by using their public records of baseball home games from 2001 to the present.$^1$ The Chicago White Sox stadium is located in Guaranteed Rate Field, which is right on the dividing line of community areas 34 (Armour Square) and 60 (Bridgeport). This project focused on the crimes that occurred in these community areas in particular in an effort to see whether or not “game days” (that is, days where there was a formal baseball game in the stadium with a live attendance) had a significant impact on the frequency of reported incidents of crime in those areas. R was used for data manipulation, including removing unnecessary rows and variables, creating new variables to use as predictors in the analysis, merging data on crimes and games into one data set, and more. Web scrapping techniques with R were used in acquiring the data on the dates and times of Chicago White Sox home games.


# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the R Markdown you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > HTML/CSS > PDF. You can even use the bibliography the same way [@R-posterdown].

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam placerat augue at velit tincidunt semper. Donec elementum porta posuere. Nullam interdum, odio at tincidunt feugiat, turpis nisi blandit eros, eu posuere risus felis non quam. Nam eget lorem odio. Duis et aliquet orci. Phasellus nec viverra est.

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html")
```

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=5}
data <- iris

plot(x = data$Sepal.Length, 
     y = data$Sepal.Width, 
     col = data$Species,
     pch = 19, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")

```

# Next Steps

Aliquam sed faucibus risus, quis efficitur erat. Vestibulum semper mauris quis tempus eleifend. Aliquam sagittis dictum ipsum, quis viverra ligula eleifend ut. Curabitur sagittis vitae arcu eget faucibus. In non elementum felis. Duis et aliquam nunc. Nunc pulvinar sapien nunc, vel pretium nisi efficitur in. Fusce fringilla maximus leo et maximus. Fusce at ligula laoreet, iaculis mi at, auctor odio. Praesent sed elementum justo. Aenean consectetur risus rhoncus tincidunt efficitur. Praesent dictum mauris at diam maximus maximus [@R-posterdown].

# Conclusion

Try `posterdown` out! Hopefully you like it!
